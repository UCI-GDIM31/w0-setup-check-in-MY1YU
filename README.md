# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. I am Mick Yu. My pronoun is he/him. I like moba, FPS, rhythm, visual novels, and fighting games. I am taking this class because I want to go further in the game industry. I have done a small visual novel project when I was in high school. I also have some experiences with unreal engine using the blueprint. Probably rhythm games and visual novels are the two I want to build this quarter.

2. Undecided

3. I take this class because it's required. But I never done C# before. I used to do JAVA and blueprint so I still think this class will be very beneficial.
4. I am not very good at group work since I have mild social anxiety. However, I hope everything would be fine.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Java

2. Unreal Engine 5

3. no experiences with Unity

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document N/A

2. Scope management N/A

3. Iteration N/A

4. Object-Oriented programming N/A

5. Model-View-Controller architecture N/A
